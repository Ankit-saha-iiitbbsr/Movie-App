- In this project i'm using TheMovieDB api to get movies info.
- Also this code is fully responsive and when you scroll it will load more results❗️

## Warning
You need to get your own api key (in video we showed how!) and replace it in index.js file on line 1 :

```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```
